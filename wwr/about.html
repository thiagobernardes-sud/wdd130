            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded over a decade ago by a group of friends passionate about rivers and outdoor adventures, White
                Water Rafting began
                as a small local initiative offering weekend rafting trips. What started with just a single inflatable
                raft soon grew
                into a recognized adventure company, attracting enthusiasts from all over the country. Over the years,
                we have expanded
                our routes, invested in professional training, and strengthened our commitment to safety and
                environmental
                sustainability. Today, White Water rafting proudly stands as a symbol of teamwork, adrenaline, and
                respect for nature,
                continuing to share the thrill of rafting with people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>
